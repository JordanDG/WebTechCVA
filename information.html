            <p id="information_section1_text">The Virus can spread through numerous means. It is mainly caught by contact with those that are carrying it, or by touching something that they've touched recently. The virus is estimated to be able to remain on surfaces for up to 48 hours, if left unsanitised. The virus can Also be spread through the air. For example, if someone who is contagious sneezes into the air, the particles released can be harmful. It is recommended that people wear PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) in accordance with what they're doing. A simple trip to the shops can warrant the use of gloves or a face-mask, in the same way that a visit to a hospital would naturally warrant the use of more advanced protection, such as face-shields, N95 masks and more. The dangerous thing about the virus is it can be spread by people who do not show symptoms. The virus takes up to 14 days to display symptoms, within which time the virus can be spread. The virus has not presently displayed the ability to transfer to household pets (such as cats or dogs), therefore making pets safe to own throughout this pandemic. But how can the virus be prevented?</p>

            <img src="images/information_covid3.jpg" alt="PPE usage image" id="information_section2_image">
            <p id="information_section2_text">Symptoms of the virus are a clear identifier to confirm whether someone is infected. Currently there are seven symptoms synonymous with the virus, with two being the most important. The first symptom, and arguably the most important, is a persistent cough lasting more than two weeks. This important symptom is an early indicator of an infection. Another symptom is shortness of breath, whilst mainly common in more serious cases, this is still a dangerous symptom to consider. The second main symptom is a consistently high temperature. This temperature should remain high (upwards of 40&#8451;) for two weeks before seeking professional help assistance. Other less common symptoms also include chills, muscle pain, a sore throat and a new loss of taste or smell. If you're displaying numerous symptoms from this list, the government advises you to dial 111 to get immediate professional help. With the government constantly ramping up their testing procedures, it has never been easier to get tested and recieve the subsequent help you would deserve. </p>

            <h1 id="information_section3_header" class="information_section3_header">How has the UK responded?</h1>
            <p id="information_section3_text">The government has instigated a lockdown since March 23rd. The lockdown restricted the general public's movement, ensuring they remain in their homes except for one form of exercise a day, and travelling for supplies from supermarkets. All non-essential workers were also furloughed, a new scheme from the government whereby they pay 80% of a persons wages, with the other 20% often being upheld by their employer. This scheme ensures people currently out of work still recieve money, as bills, rent and shopping have remained intact throughout the lockdown. The lockdown has overall been a stunning success, with the rate of infections steadily slowing throughout. Whilst this is the case, there have been numerous protests against the lockdown since its instigation, with hundreds of members of the public grouping together (and therefore ignoring social distancing) to protest to 'save their freedom.' This coupled with the blatant disregard the unfortunate minority of the general public display, has significantly muted the positive impact of the lockdown measures. The future is certainly uncertain in this regard.</p>
