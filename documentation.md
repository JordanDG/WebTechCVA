<p>This is the 1500 word accompaniment documentation to the Web Technologies website (CVA.)</p>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>Throughout the early decision process, I felt it was appropriate to stand out amongst what was inevitably going to be a cascade of portfolio websites (as per the limitations of the brief.) It was for this reason that I decided to focus on creating a website to “promote an environmental cause”. I wanted my website to remain informative, whilst staying current to the issues that exist in society at present. For this reason, I chose to theme my website around the Covid19 pandemic. This has been a hugely important global problem, with hundreds of thousands of people losing their lives.</p>
<p>The media has been hugely conflicting throughout, with important information differing between news outlets, making it unclear as to what the best cause of action is for the general public to take. This website aims to solve these issues by the implementation of a centralised platform for informing the general public reliably, with all information sourced from credible sources (such as the NHS and WHO.) The website provides key information, relevant news and videos to the user, as well as acting as a platform for users to contact the site directly with any queries or concerns they may have.</p>
<p>I felt it was important to differ from the assumed norm (a portfolio website) as I felt this format was over saturated, with most deciding this was the best course of action to take. With the vast wealth of knowledge made publicly available by the NHS and WHO, I felt it was necessary to provide a platform whereby the key important aspects of this information were presented on an effective and easy to access platform. Throughout development I ensured the website was easy to use and navigate, with a wealth of options made available through the navigation, which featured consistently throughout the webpage (both in the desktop and moble versions.)</p>
<h1 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h1>
<p>Early on in the design process, wireframes were created to map out the planned layouts for each page, on each platform. Below are examples of these wireframes, each taken from a different page.<br>

This wireframe details the intended homepage of the website as viewed on a desktop. each important element of the website is labelled to ensure a clear and efficient plan is formed prior to the production of the website. I chose to produce an image carousel early on, however I chose to make it slightly different through the use of an automated, splitting slideshow. both sides of the display would slide into their corresponding side, where they would be changed to their replacements and slid back into place. This was designed to be the primary feature of the home page. The header section (denoted by the separating line) contained the logo of the website, the websites name and the navigation. This would not change on all pages of the website, with the only exception being that whichever page the user was currently on would be underlined on the navigation.</p>

This second wireframe diagram details the rest of the homepage (as viewed on a desktop.) This section will featured a video created by the NHS to dispel common misconceptions regarding the Virus. The four boxes towards the bottom of the page will be interactive, allowing users to change each country they are displaying. This was done to provide a huge amount of information selectively to users that request it.<br>

The footer of the homepage remained similar across all platforms, featuring the logo and links to all the current pages of the site, styled identically to the navigation present at the top of the page. Below are interpretations of the homepage as viewed on different platforms, such as a tablet and a mobile.<br>

<h1 id="colour-choices">Colour Choices</h1>
<p>The colours used on the website were chosen to contrast. This features heavily into the accessibility of the website, whereby using contrasting colours enables contents to be legibly read by users with visual impairments. For this reason, the main colours used consisted of shades of white and black. These colours are connotative with modern website development, clarity and purity, all aspects that my website aimed to convey. The accent colour of the website was a deep navy blue. This was chosen as it was similar to the colours used by both the NHS and WHO. The colour blue is also emotive of trust and confidence, something users should experience upon visiting the website. Below is the style guide showing this.<br>

<h1 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h1>
<p>Features of accessibility were used throughout the site to ensure it is usable by those with impairments. A primary example of this is the use of alternate text on all images present on the site. This is useful to ensure that users still understand what the image contains, should the image not load.</p>
<p>Another example of accessibility used on my site is the use of contrasting colours. The website conforms to the W3C accessibility standards through the use of contrasting colours to regulate the identity of text contents and their backgrounds. The website has also been updated to support tablet and mobile viewing (at specific points.) Only two of these were initially used (as per the brief), but this number was expanded upon as a result of testing the site on different platforms.</p>
<h1 id="gdpr">GDPR</h1>
<p>The website conforms to the GDPR by presenting the user with a privacy policy upon visiting the homepage (the default point of entry for users.) The privacy policy explains the usage of cookies on the site, breaking down the definitions of each, , how to remove them and giving the user the opportunity to find out more or to simply accept this and close the window. The website cannot be navigated without this window being addressed.  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/TRFSwyx.png" alt="CVA Privacy Policy"><br>
The website has been carefully constructed to avoid infringing on the 8 rights of individuals provided by the GDPR. Privacy policy clearly informs users that some information may be stored (such as their preferences and interests) while using the site, but not shared with individuals under any means. This information would only be taken to improve the experience of the user when using the website. These GDPR rights are mainly targeted towards websites featuring a login/signup system, something my website does not contain, simply as I felt there was no need for this.</p>
<h1 id="distance-selling">Distance Selling</h1>
<p>My website is not an e-commerce platform, therefore no goods or services are being sold, only free impartial advice from medical professionals is being (albeit hypothetically) offered, at no charge.</p>
<h1 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h1>
<p>I feel my website provides users with an immersive, informative and trustworthy platform to confide in and refer to when facing concerns about the threat of the coronavirus. My aim for the website was to provide factual information and a communication platform whereby concerned users can contact a professional to seek assistance. Whilst the threat of Covid19 is great, it is worsened by the miscommunication and engorgement of information by the media. This website successfully disregards this, and focuses solely on providing the information necessary.</p>
<p>Throughout the development stage, I encountered numerous problems that hindered development. The most notable of these being through the reusability of Javascript function. Many functions would rely on variables taken from the HTML page the function was local to. Whilst this means that the function worked well on that page, it did not function on other pages, as the required variables were not present. This was remedied by altering functions to support cross-page usage, and in some cases (where this could not be completed) re-writing the entire function to support the local variables correctly.<br>
I hosted my website locally, visiting it on various devices, to test the media queries and made relevant changes when necessary. This was done on each page, at various stages of their development.</p>
<p>Viewing existing websites thematically similar to mine enabled me to identify that their sole focus was on the presentation of information. This indicated that I should focus on presenting a large quantity of trust-worthy information. The colours used on these sites were also similar to my planned colour scheme, therefore confirming my choice. The use of white-space was also reflected on these websites, indicating to me that white-space was essential for the clarity and usability of the website by others. Overall the website was a success, Next time I would spend more time working on the Privacy Policy and cookie options, giving users the ability to manually opt out, should they choose.</p>
